"""Project / application detection.

A "project" (application) is a directory that owns assets. Apps do NOT only live
under one home-relative folder — on a real Linux server they are scattered across
`/opt`, `/srv`, `/var/www`, `/usr/local`, user homes, etc. This detector therefore
scans a CONFIGURABLE set of roots with a sensible full-disk default (see
`config.yml` → `paths.direct_roots` / `paths.scan_roots`) so an app installed
anywhere on disk shows up — it can never silently regress to a single directory.

Projects are discovered from:
  - direct subfolders of each *direct* root — `projects_root` plus `direct_roots`
    (the classic "one folder per app" install layout: /opt/<app>, /srv/<app>, …),
  - a bounded, guarded filesystem scan for project markers
    (docker-compose.yml / .git) under both the direct roots AND the broader
    `scan_roots` — so nested/scattered projects are found without turning every
    subfolder of /home into a "project", and
  - Docker Compose working-dirs (passed in via `discovered`) — the exact host
    path of each compose app, wherever it lives.

Full-disk-scan hazards are guarded: pseudo-filesystems (/proc, /sys, /dev, /run)
and network/tmpfs/overlay/squashfs mounts are skipped, traversal depth is bounded
by both the configured `scan_depth` and a hard ceiling, noise dirs
(node_modules, .git, venv, snap/flatpak internals, …) are excluded,
permission-denied is tolerated per-dir, and a wall-clock deadline caps the whole
detector so a scan can never hang the pipeline. A configured root that exists but
cannot be read is logged LOUDLY with a named reason (it is not swallowed); a root
that is merely absent on this box is skipped quietly.

Every project carries its full path, so scattered layouts (/data/x,
/home/data/project/y, …) are listed with their real location. Assets whose path
falls under a project's directory get that project (longest-prefix wins);
everything else is "System". Project names are NEVER inferred from service-name
prefixes (the V5 'cloud-init -> Cloud' bug).
